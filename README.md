These are some of my assignments I did in my college entry level programming class.

    Assingment 01 was the first assignment in the class.  I chose to build a skyline.  I was learneing mainly the mapping of processing as well as very basic functions such as shapes and shades.
    Assignment 03 was me not understanding programming well.  I was attempting to make it work but I failed epically.
    Assignment 06 was raindrops that change colors based on where they are at on the map.  It was me starting to understand programming much better than before.
    Assignment 07 was me using a push/popMatrix to make the drawing into a carnival like object.  The orbs are supposed to represent gleams bouncing off the object.
    Assignment f17 was a collaborative project using P3D and lighting to make certain effects happen in the sketch.  The skull is loaded into the sketch.
